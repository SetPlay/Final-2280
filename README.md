Bio-Metric Bear

Final FALL 2017 MTEC 2280

In this project i wanted to create something that functioned as a companion for children who are ill or as a device for parents to monitor there children in a manner that if inviting and unintrusive. However still able to provide biometric analyze of child without the need of thermometers and stuff synonymous with a hospital visit.

The Bio-Metric Bear was then the idea i decided was the most friendly and inviting while being large enough to monitor a child from a range of sizes.
